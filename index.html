            <section>
                <p>
                    Going on vacations is so much fun. You get to explore the place, the food, the diversity of
                    nature.
                    But when you are in the middle of a desert with nothing around for miles and miles and those hunger
                    pangs hit,
                    you know its not going to be fun anymore.
                </p>

                <p>For emergencies like this, I like to carry my homemade energy (granola) bites.
                    It is a much loved snack in our family when you are hungry or when you are not hungry but just
                    craving for
                    something sweet.
                    This has almost always been a staple when we go traveling, and has been a lifesaver many times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is a much tried and tested recipe and I would like to share it with you today.
                    These bite-sized granola bars are a nutritious blend of nuts, dried fruits and more.
                    They are the easiest thing in the world to make... and when you are bored of them, you can always
                    refresh
                    the recipe with few additions and subtractions to change the flavor and taste.
                </p>

                <p> These energy bites have a long shelf life, stay well in room temperature and can be easily made in
                    the food processor.
                </p>

                <p> So here goes.

                        The beauty of this recipe is you can make it with as many items in the list or with as fewer
                        items in your pantry. They still taste delicious and are equally nutritious.

                    <h3> Tips </h3>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Store them in a container in the refrigerator and they stay well for up to 2-3 weeks.</li>
                        <li>If you reduce the dates and figs to about a third of what's listed in the recipe, you can
                            have
                            it as a dry mix to be sprinkled on greek yogurts or ice creams etc.</li>
                        <li>If you reduce the nuts to 2 types instead of 3 types mentioned, you can reduce the dates by
                            about 0.75cups.</li>
                        <li>Feel free to tweak the recipe and make it your own. This is a very forgiving recipe. If at
                            any
                            time, you think the mixture is too dry, add some more dates or figs and that should fix the
                            issue.
                        </li>
                        <li>I have tried this recipe with addition of maple syrup or honey for additional moisture for
                            binding
                            ingredients without increasing dates or figs.</li>
                        <li>You can also halve the recipe to make 35 bites instead of the 70.</li>
                    </ol>
