      <section>
         In my blog today, I would love to share a tried and tested recipe with you that has become as staple in my
         family.
         We eat it for snack or when we are craving for something sweet. Sometimes we even take it along when we go
         traveling. <br>

         These energy bites are a nutritious mix of nuts, dried fruits and some other stuff. These are the easiest thing
         in
         the world to make, and when you get bored of eating them, you can refresh the recipe with few additions and
         subtractions.<br>

         It has a long shelf life, and can be easily made in the food processor. Today, I am going to share the recipe
         for
         - Energy Bites. So here goes. <br>


         <h2>Energy Bites</h2>

         The beauty of this recipe is you can make it with as many items in the list or with fewer items that you have
         at
         home. They still taste delicious and are equally nutritious.

         <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

         <ul>
            <li>2 cups each of Almonds, Walnuts, pecans toasted</li>
            <li>1 cup Sesame seeds,</li>
            <li>1 cup Sunflower seeds toasted</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups pitted Dates (50-60) - Yes! You need a lot of them, for binding the dry ingredients</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup Figs (18-20)</li>
            <li>2 tsp Cinnamon powder</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Optional:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup Chia seeds (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Clove powder</li>
            <li>1 cup Oats (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Cranberries</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Method:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Toast the items mentioned as toasted if not already done so.</li>
            <li>Bring out your food processor, and blend them.</li>
            <li>Spread them out on parchment paper in a tray. Flatten it out, and cut into bite sized squares.</li>
            <li>Voila, your Energy Bites are ready! The recipe makes about 70 bites.</li>
         </ol>

         <br>

         <h3> Tips: </h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Store them in a container in the refrigerator and they stay well for up to 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>If you reduce the dates and figs to about a third of what's listed in the recipe, you can have it as a
               dry mix to be sprinkled on greek yogurts or ice creams etc.</li>
            <li>If you reduce the nuts to 2 instead of 3, you can reduce the dates by about 0.75cups.</li>
            <li>Feel free to tweak the recipe and make it your own. This is a very forgiving recipe. If at any time, you
               think the mixture is too dry, add some more dates or figs and that should fix the issue.</li>
            <li>I have tried this recipe with addition of maple syrup/honey for additional moisture for binding
               ingredients without increasing dates/ figs.</li>
            <li>You can also halve the recipe to make 35 bites instead of the 70.</li>
         </ol>
         <br>

         <p>I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I have enjoyed listing it out for you.
